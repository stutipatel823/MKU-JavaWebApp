## Docker & Kubernetes Microservices Tutorial

This repository is designed for learning and experimenting with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** in the context of microservices architecture. The tutorial covers the following concepts:

1. **Containerizing Microservices** using Docker.
2. **Orchestrating Microservices** with Docker Compose.
3. **Deploying Microservices** with Kubernetes for scalability and management.

### Project Breakdown:
- **L1**: A basic microservice setup using Docker, running a single web app and its corresponding database in containers.
- **L2**: A more advanced setup using **Kubernetes**, managing multiple microservices with services and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).
- **L3**: Running two microservices with **Docker Compose** to simulate a multi-container environment.
